went on an exciting site visit to the Terra Residence

which is currently under construction in Rangsit Faculty members Prof

Dieter Trau Dr Krishna Chaitanya and Dr Khin Myat Kyaw

went on the trip with them The trip provided the

students with invaluable insights into innovative construction techniques The Terra

Residence project stands tall with floors nearing completion and finishing

works underway During the visit students were introduced to various

cost effective techniques employed in the construction process highlighting the

project s commitment to innovation and efficiency One of the

notable techniques observed was the utilization of post tensioning to

reduce slab thickness enhancing structural integrity while minimizing material usage

A comprehensive approach to affordability and sustainability was also demonstrated

by using flat slabs reducing building costs Moreover the incorporation

of chicken mesh in walls before plastering displayed a practical

approach to improving wall strength and durability This method helps

to increase the structural resilience and lifespan of the building

The use of slip form techniques for concreting the lift

shaft was another noteworthy observation made during the visit This

method ensures a smooth and efficient construction process resulting in

the timely completion of vertical elements with precision and accuracy

Rahul Kasaudhan a structural engineering student shared his excitement about

the visit saying I went to the Terra Residence construction

site with other students I learned about affordable construction sustainable

materials and cool techniques like post tensioning and flat slabs

A great chance to see theory come to life Overall

the site visit to Terra Residence strengthened the students academic

knowledge and equipped them for upcoming challenges in the field

of structural engineering by giving them a firsthand understanding of

innovative construction practices We extend our gratitude to the Terra

Residence Team for offering our students the invaluable opportunity to

gain practical experience through this visit to their building Terra

Residence Rangsit offers a modern living experience in a vibrant

community Situated amidst lush greenery it provides a serene retreat

while conveniently located near essential amenities and transportation hubs With

CodeCourseNumber of CreditsDescription Course Systems systems with biological components interacting

with social and economic elements are extremely complex in nature

This course is designed to introduce concepts and techniques of

systems analysis in an agricultural context and to illustrate the

value of holistic approach through a number of quite different

case studies The manager or the administrator of such a

system constantly looks forward to those techniques or methods which

helps him in planning scheduling and controlling the activities in

the system The course should help students in identifying rational

ways to improve the efficiency of agricultural systems Jan and

Testing of Agricultural course is essential for practicing design engineers

providing combined theoretical and practical techniques as well as using

computer graphic design that can improve the design efficiency and

improvement in performance of agricultural equipment through standard testing and

evaluation Students will have their opportunities to use engineering principle

innovation and computer aided design to develop selected machine and

tool that appropriated to agricultural production in most of Asia

Aug food production depends on judicious use of the changes

of the environment how they could be modified by land

management practices and their consequences for land productivity available agro

ecological resources Therefore maintenance of vegetation management of pests conservation

and efficient management of soil water and nutrients and plant

residue management are essential components of appropriate land utilization The

selection of suitable crops and cropping systems and their management

require knowledge of the climatic physical and biotic determinants of

plant growth both in terms of their magnitude and quality

This course provides information on short term and long term

Aug Productivity productivity depends on eco physiological conditions and crop

management practices and their interactions Crops respond differently to soil

and climatic conditions The selection of suitable crops and crop

management practices for given geographical locations is critical for the

sustainability of crop productivity Crop productivity management demands a systems

approach Hence understanding soil and aerial environments and their variability

performance of crops under such changing conditions while maintaining soil

parameters that govern soil productivity are important in the overall

management of crop productivity This course provides students with an

understanding of soil productivity the dynamics of soil processes and

their relevance for biomass production of crops Aug Management provide

a framework for better understanding the operation and management of

farming system by the subsistence and semi subsistence farm household

in the Asian region by i incorporation of the use

of tools of farm management analysis in solving local problems

ii demonstration of the relationship of farm management research to

policy formulation and its impact on farmers income and iii

development of the students awareness of farm problems in different

countries Aug agriculture is a new concept in production The

course aims to educate students to deal with the comprehensive

approach to crop production planning and implementation It deals with

three key elements information and advanced agricultural technologies and management

Jan Soil of soil water interactions is necessary to understand

the crop water response to inputs Similarly to design the

mechanisms or systems and tools used in for off road

conditions and in soils knowledge of tillage and traction theories

is essential This course is designed to upgrade students with

related theories and practices Jan and Measurement is no substitute

for careful experimentation as well as analyses techniques interpreting experimental

data in many areas of basic research and applied product

development It is mandatory to use reliable instruments and to

follow standard procedures to obtain accurate results in experimental research

This course is designed to give students a sufficient background

of analytical and experimental considerations of various instruments and how

to use them for the measurement of various parameters some

of which they might come across in their thesis research

and further professional activities Jan Environment agricultural production in controlled

environment is becoming popular to overcome limitations of agricultural land

and vagaries of nature especially for the production of high

value crops The objective of the course is to provide

understanding of the factors involved in greenhouse and nursery production

of high value crops and plants Aug Eco physiology and

responses to physical biotic and management parameters determine the magnitude

and quality of yield Physiological parameters determine the net assimilation

in a crop system Knowledge of physical biotic and management

parameters and their interactions will help ensure optimal productivity of

cropping systems Computer simulation models of the soil crop atmosphere

system help understand the processes determining crop responses to changes

in system components predict crop performance under different location specific

conditions and guide management decisions Jan Pest pest management IPM

has become the conceptual basis for small and large scale

plant protection programs throughout Asia This course emphasizes the ecological

basis of pest management the techniques and experiences involved and

place them in context with socio economic aspects Therefore this

course will be offered to provide guidance on how to

approach pest management in its entirety and how to practically

handle a case using a learning cycle approach experimentation based

on science Jan Sector and Policy develop an understanding of

the role of agriculture sector on economic growth and its

policy impact on food security income distribution and environmental improvement

which are essential for sustainable development Aug Agriculture Production Operations

production systems differ widely in terms of their operations and

performance Selection of appropriate production system is largely influenced by

and vice versa affects to the region s prevailing demography

environment economy and infrastructure which eventually determines the status of

poverty and food security This course provides broad knowledge of

the various farm production activities carried out by suitable agricultural

machines and equipment in the broader context of sustainability Energy

input output analysis approach is followed to meter and compare

different operations and systems on sustainability yardstick Aug Agriculture and

Ecological impart knowledge on major and emerging issues and viewpoints

confronting modern high input industrialized agriculture and society in relation

to conservation of the soil environment and sustainable development through

effective management of agricultural resources Aug Irrigation irrigation systems can

save a huge amount of water and help to achieve

agricultural sustainability A significant amount of water is wasted if

traditional irrigation methods are used due to inefficiencies in irrigation

evaporation and overwatering Smart irrigation systems use the latest technologies

such as sensors models IoT devices for real time or

historical data monitoring to provide efficient irrigation schedules The course

provides students with an understanding of applications of smart irrigation

technologies to optimize water use for crops Students will also

become familiar with variable rate irrigation VRI technology and cropping
